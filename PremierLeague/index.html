					<h2>What is the project about?</h2>
					<p>The whole project focuses on the English football (soccer) League.
						The project limits the data to only the top league in England which
						is referred to as the English Premier League
						<a href="https://www.premierleague.com/" style="color: black">(EPL)</a>. As seen in the
						five other tabs in the navigation bar (History, Overall, Champions, Solid
						teams, and Top scorers), five pages are dedicated to visualize different
						stories derived from the collected data. 'History' page utilizes Flourish
						to show an animated horizontal bar chart. 'Overall and Champions' use tableau
						to show animated historical data by using filters and pages features.
						The last two pages use D3 to visualize the strongest teams in the EPL
						and the top scorers of all time. The project has been an interesting
						work to work with. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

					<h2>Data: How did we compile it and Where did we get it?</h2>
					<p>The plan for this project is to focous on the main information about each
						team in the EPL. The important information were gathered from the year 1888
						till 2018. For each season, the collected information were like the number of games played
						per season, total wins (Home wins + Away wins), same for total losses, and draws.
						More information were gathered to show how each team performed in each season like
						the number of goalos scored for and against each team and the goal differences.
						Top scorers of all time data were collected too to show who are the best scorers
						of all time in the EPL.</p>
					<p>The data was normalized, compiled, cleaned and divided. Therefore, The data
						is unique because there is no complete online compiled data like ours in a single csv file. The data
						can be found in website to be browsed from page to page, but it cannot be found as stand-alone
						data.</p>
					<p>Here is how it was collected: two websites have provided most of the data:
						<a href="https://fbref.com/" style="color: black">fbref.com</a>
						(to download:<a href="assets/data/fbref.com.zip" style="color: black">click here</a> )
						and <a href="https://footballcsv.github.io/" style="color: black">Open Public Domain Football Data</a>
						(to download: <a href="assets/data/england-master.zip" style="color: black">click here</a>). The second website
						Open Public Domain Football Data has data from 1888 to 1992 . The first website fbref has data from 1992 to 2018.
						However, they were scattered. The data needed to be compiled, cleaned, and normalized. There were many missing values
						that have been collected from the main source website of the <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/" style="color: black">EPL</a>
						. The final compiled data (our work) is in this file that can be downloaded
						<a href="assets/data/All_Data_main_V3.xlsx" style="color: black">Full Data</a>. Another data was collected about the top scorers
						of all team. It can be downloaded from <a href="assets/data/topscorers.csv" style="color: black">here</a>.
						Other datasets that were derived from the main data into small chunks were the following:
						<a href="assets/data/bar2.csv" style="color: black">download data2, </a>
						<a href="assets/data/bar3.csv" style="color: black">download data3</a>.
