Recently newly admitted students reached out to me on LinkedIn and asked me about my experience as a graduating MEng student here. I've collected enough conversations to post a Q&A here.

### Who am I?

I was admitted to the MSCS program for Fall 2019. During my 2 years study here, I lived near VT - [Northern Virginia Center](https://www.nvc.vt.edu){:target="_blank"}. I went to the center by metro or bike. I couldn't find an intern job or a faculty to work with during Summer 2020 so I transferred to the MEng CS program then.

### Can I register for the courses from the other campus?

A year ago I couldn't register for any course based in Blacksburg. Currently, my 2 of 3 courses this semester are based in Blacksburg. Before the pandemic, DC students are hosted in a classroom and Zoom rooms are set up to connect two campuses. If you're going to focus on projects I'd say it's better to stay in DC. Most of the MEng students are currently in DC. It will be easier to collaborate/connect. 

### How are the faculty and research opportunities distributed among the two campuses?

For now, the majority of faculty and research is based in Blacksburg as well as the courses. I'd say it's 70:30. However, VT has this big plan that they want to achieve 1500(?) admission of MEng students by 2025 or 2030. [Here](https://vt.edu/innovationcampus/about.html){:target="_blank"}'s the accurate number They are starting to move some of the faculty over and more courses are offered on the DC campus.

### Will this change in the near future?

I'd say it will be close to 50:50 but Blacksburg will still have more since many related majors will take CS courses as well and VT doesn't seem to have a plan to move students of other programs/majors to DC. I'm studying in DC. I'm pursuing MEng CS and this is my last semester.

### How does the transfer work?

Now that you're admitted to Blacksburg, it worth a try to stay there for at least a semester and decide whether you want to transfer. If I could pick again I would choose Blacksburg.

I believe it's not complicated to transfer after you came. I see that you applied for the MEng program and that you are a working professional. So I guess you want more project-oriented experience rather than research experience?

Overall I'm satisfied. As I mentioned, I would have transferred if I was given the chance again. Both campuses offer courses of great quality and rich hands-on experience.

### From your experience, do you enjoy the experience in NoVA?

DC campus doesn't provide accommodation on housing and it's much more expensive to live in DC. rent in Blacksburg for 1 person in a shared apartment (2 bedrooms or 3 bedrooms) will be in the range of 300-500, while that in DC will cost 700-1000 I wouldn't call it a campus since it's only two buildings with no campus activities. After the pandemic, if the professor lives near buildings they will come into the classroom. For other classes broadcast from Blackburg, professors will be teaching in classrooms in Blackburg.

One thing that I don't like about DC is that they currently only have 2 buildings for students. You'll probably only come to the building for a class. You can search the timeline on the new building in Innovation Campus, but I remember that they won't be ready very soon. One of the reasons that make VT famous is the Blacksburg campus and the academic atmosphere there. I went there once and really like the campus there.

### Do you know anything about Blacksburg?

Blacksburg is in a valley in the countryside and jobs around DC usually require a security clearance. So you're likely going to find jobs elsewhere. VT has a huge alumni group for you to discover. And the reputation of VT graduates in the job market is overall positive. The job fair offered by the university and by the CS department mainly focuses on companies based in Virginia and DC.

### What about international students?

I'm guessing that you came here on an F-1 visa? For a student visa, a job that requires security clearance is basically a no. Ignore this if you have another status. CS job fair just ended and the only tech giant joined is Bloomberg (more of a tech/finance giant). I would say that job fairs at VT are not the primary resource for job hunting. There's something called Hokie connect that is like an internal version of LinkedIn that allows you to connect with alumni.

### How does career/job fair work?

I attended the job fair but I just stayed in the lobby for a while since most of the companies that came to the job fair either require a security clearance or do not provide sponsorship. Internships are quite essential in applying for a full-time job after you graduate. I applied for several internships last spring but it was the outbreak of COVID-19 in the US, some were rejected while several internships I got admitted were canceled. From my friends' experience, the best destination for the internship is Amazon and you should apply in September of October.

### What is a security clearance?

It's not likely that we (international students) will try to pass a security clearance. I think then won't let you do that. Usually, the mention of security clearance defaults that you are a US citizen.

### How's the interview like for an internship?

The interview for the internship focuses on coding problems from hackerrank and leetcode. Students from VT tend to be preferred in both resume filtering and tech interview as VT alumni are outstanding in the industry. Many students I know went to Amazon, Walmart, Facebook, etc.

### Reputation of Virginia Tech?



### What's a normal timespan for an MS/MEng program?

It's advised to finish MEng in 3 semesters and MS in 4 semesters. If you are looking for a job after the program then MEng is the fastest way to do so. However, it is relatively harder to find an assistantship as an MEng student, because many MS students are coming in at the same time and professors often turn to MS students for research or teaching assistants.

I would recommend that you do a 3 - 4 - 3 since you'll need to work on Capstone Project at the end of your program. There're also plenty of courses offered during winter/summer break and I see many students did so to reduce their workload during spring/fall. You can enroll in 3 or more courses if you like but you can also do something like 3-3-3-1. You are allowed to enroll in less than 3 in the final semester.

### What are the courses from the summer semester like?

These are some courses offered in Summer 2020:
CS-5024	Ethics & Professionalism in CS
CS-5040 Intermed Data Struct/Algorithm
CS 5244 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
CS-4114	Formal Languages

I can't find a record of a winter course schedule now. But you can definitely ask the contact on your admission letter or coordinator of the MEng program.

I'd say most winter/summer courses are job-oriented. Most of them focus on the skills that you can put on your resume.

### Do you recommend taking Ethics related courses?

I think there's a degree requirement that you have to take ethics? I've taken it and I think it's a great course to spark your thoughts on the flip side of these technologies. I think recruiters value your project experience more than just which course you've taken.

### How many graduate students get funded every semester?

It depends on the faculty. There'll be a weekly newsletter on all kinds of job/research opportunities. Coordinators and faculty from graduate school will send position descriptions if they need a Master's student. Also since VT is trying to expand, if you did well in a course project you can always reach out to the instructor and see if there's further research that you can work on. Once you show that you want to put into the effort it's likely that they will accept you as assistants first. I've heard of several students who transferred their program to the Ph.D. program after a semester or two.

### So there's not a chance for MEng students?

I'd say Virginia Tech is really supportive of graduate students. If you did well in a course, you can go after the instructor to see if there's a chance to expand your project into a conference paper. As you start to work with a professor and he/she sees your effort, you're likely to get at least partly funded.
