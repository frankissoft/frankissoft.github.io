I went through two rounds of spam job application: last spring and this spring so far. Looking back at what I did last year - even this January, I found mistakes all over my application process. There's always a blank for me to type in my website. Sometimes I use LinkedIn, sometimes Tableau, other times GitHub. These pages don't really represent me as I didn't use them as a place to present myself. There are millions of blogs writing about how to build personal blogs. While my graduation date is really close now, I guess it's better that i work on myself first instead of spamming applications that will upset me anyways.

This website is a start that I look forward to. Even when I'm writing nonsense here, I get better at Git, markdown, and lots of stuff. I also want to put more of my work here and use the website as a motivation on crafting my projects and ideas.
